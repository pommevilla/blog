I'm Paul Villanueva, a bioinformatics PhD candidate in the [GERMS lab](http://www.germslab.org/). I use data science to answer questions about how human activity is impacting, particularly agriculture, is impacting the environment around us. 

This blog collects some of the random things I've worked on or found interesting (typically when I'm procrastinating from writing my dissertation).
